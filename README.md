### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brian Green and I am highly experienced software developer with a passion for building innovative and robust software solutions that deliver business value and solve real-world problems. I have worked at Jumpcloud, LogMeIn, Citrix Online, Expertcity, Metatools and Dive Labs.

The bulk of my coding has been in C/C++, but starting in 2000 I shifted my focus to cloud computing and learned Golang, JavaScript, React as well as AWS.

Here is a collection of my work ranging from personal projects, to interview 'homework' problems, to coding tutorials to basic code samples.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Vehicle maintenance tracking system
- Go microservices demo

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
-   Terraform
-   Github Actions
-   Blockchain
-   100 days of coding in Python
-   TypeScript

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects using Golang, Python, or JavaScript.

âš¡ Fun fact: Had a dog named Clyde which led to the name 'clydotron', which (surprisingly) was available as domain name :)
